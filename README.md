# facial-recognition

Facial recognition project using convolutional nueral network and histogram of gradient direction. With CPU support I use HoG and with GPU support CNN. GPU support will provide higher accuracy with the ability to lower the Euclidean distance threshhold when classifying a face. To gather the data set I used Bing's search API.
